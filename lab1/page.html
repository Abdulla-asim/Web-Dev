        <h2 title="Introduction">About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Abdullah Asim, a Computer Science student at NUST with a deep passion 
            for Ethical Hacking and Machine Learning/Deep Learning. 
            My journey in tech is driven by a curiosity to explore cutting-edge technologies 
            and solve real-world problems through innovation.
        </p>
        <p>I have experience with creating Deep Learning models using PyTorch framework for 
            solving modern problems.

        <h3>Machine Learning/Deep Learning</h3>
        <p>
            During my last summer break (2024), I decided to learn something new and Machine 
            Learning caught my interest. 
            I took the <strong>Machine Learning Specialization</strong> by Andrew Ng from 
            Coursera.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm interested in applications like NLP, computer vision, and AI security.
        </p>

        <h3>Ethical Hacking</h3>
        <p>
            I had been interested in hacking for a long time and last summer I decided 
            to learn ethical hacking.
            I knew I needed vast knowledge and a strong foundation in Computer Networks to 
            be a great Ethical Hacker. And so, I decided to learn
            Computer Networks. Ironically, it wasn't hard and tiring as I had thought it would 
            be. On the contrary, I really enjoyed it.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy learning about ethical hacking, network security, and cryptography.</p>
        <p>I'm currently exploring Bug Bounty Hunting.</p>
